  <h1>Shadow Eye</h1>
    
  <p>This is a fictional game and does not actually exist</p>
  
  <h2> About the game</h2>

  <p>Shadow Eye is a FPS(first-person-shooter) stealth game where the player goes through misions to save hostages while taking out the bad guys. In this project we would like to move into the direction of realism. This game also includes a multiplier full of multiple modes.
  This list includes:</p>
  
  <h2>Extraction</h2>
  
  <p> In this gamemode a group of 6 players are put into two teams where one team tries to reach hostages in the center of the map and escort them safely out into the escort point which varies depending on the map. While the other team tries to keep the intruding team from aquiring the hosteges. They will try to do anything they can to keep the hostages from being escorted. This game consists of 3 rounds and the teams will be switching sides on who is escorting and who is ambushing</p>
  <h2>Search and Destroy</h2>

  <p> In this gamemode there is 6 players on each team. One side has a bomb. Their objective is to plant the bomb at one of three planting spots around the map. The other team has to stop them from planting the bomb. If the bomb is placed it has to be deactivated or it will explode. There is 5 rounds in total.</p>

  <h2>Capture the Flag</h2>

  <p> In this gamemode there is 2 teams. 6 players in each team. The objective of the gamemode is to collect the other teams computer chip. Once one of the teams get the other teams computer chip, they have to return it to their base and claim it. There will 10-15 minutes depending on the map. The team who has captured the other teams computer chips the most will win the game.</p>

  <h2>King of the Hill</h2>

  <p> In this gamemode there will be 2 teams with a timer of 5 minutes. There will also be a point in the map that the teams have to capture. There has to be at least one person on the flag to be able to start capturing it. If there is 2 people on opposite teams on the capture point, neither team will advance in points. The longer someone on either team is on the capture point, the more points that team gets. Each second on the capture point counts as a point. The team who gets 150 points first will win the game. </p>

  <h2>Takedown</h2>

  <p>In this gamemode the conflict is not player v player, it is player v bot or ba guys. In gamemode, a group of 7 players will have to take down a mob boss in his own house. this will be a special gamemode limited to certtain events</p>

  <h1>Realism </h1>
  
  <p> Some ways we are adding realism into our game is through are interaction animations, graphics and movement. But other ways include mechanics such as how equipment works under certain conditions. For exmple weapns have hitbox and when shot or damaged they can be broken and unuseble for the player, but they can switch to their secondary or melee. These hitbox mechanics also apply for tacticals, lethals and other equipment. Also when a player dies their charcter is no longer useble with the loadout that they had so the player will  have to use a different loadout with a different character to continue the game. If a player no longer has a Loadout they will be put in spectate mode or untill the next round.</p>

  <h1> Story Mode </h1>

  <p> In the gamemode "Story Mode" it will follow the story of a young american named Matthew, training to be in a special branch of military men. This special branch is secret to the public.
