<p>Josh's Shampoo Emporium wasnt always the booming business it is now. this company started from the humble beginnings of Josh's father's zoo in Santa Barbara, California. Josh was working with some camels and one spit right into his hair! He went home that day and saw his messed up hair in the mirror, he took a thorough shower, dried his hair and boom! His hair was soft, shiny and looked like an angel had blessed him with it. He collected some more camel spit the next day and decided to start advertising and selling it to people visiting the zoo.</p>

<p>Josh decided that there were not enough people being blessed by his creation so he expanded. He hired his three friends, Ryan, Evander and Pierce. The team experimented with new animal waste and found more body products. The company expanded over the USA and was exposed to all the poor souls who havent experienced these products.</p>
