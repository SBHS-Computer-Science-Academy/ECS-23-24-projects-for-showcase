    <h1> About Our company</h1>



    <p> Our company started out as a small business that started 5 years ago. We started selling clothes at a little pop up shop by East Beach. Soon enough people started noticing our clothes and we decided to expand our business. We spent the past couple of years earning enough money to build a big store where our customers can shop in.  </p>

    <h1> Clothes made for you </h1>
    
     <p> The clothes that we make come in many diffrent sizes to fit anyone. We worked very hard to make sure that we use a perfect long lasting material that is very comfortable and stain resistent. Our shirts, hoodies, and leggings are made out of a soft strechy fabric that you can wear all day without any discomfort. And our jeans are made of a fabric that will not srink in your dryer. If you have every struggled with finding your size in a store, you wont hav ethat problum at SB Cloathing Company.  </p>

    <h1> how are buesiness started</h1>
    
    <p> We had this idea to start a business not knowing if it would make money or not. We started as a corner shop where we would spend hours hand makeing our cloaths and driving them to busy part of town to sell them. We started to get attention when groups of tourists would purchase things from our shop, we started to become a tourist attraction for santa barbara. soon enough we made enough money to expand our buisness.   </p>
