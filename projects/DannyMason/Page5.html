  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engineering</td>
    <td>Variety of potential jobs, high average pay </td>
    <td>It requires a great deal of technical prowess, a robust foundation in mathematics and science, and a strong work ethic to tackle the challenging curriculum</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Architecture</td>
    <td> There is only a 2% unemployent rate for architects and you are able to become an architect, interior designer, urban planner, and restoration manager</td>
    <td> Given the focus on both art and science, architecture projects are often extreamly demanding and require a very high attention to detail. It’s also difficult to become a licensed architect: you also typically need to complete a 3-5 year internship and pass an exam. During your years of undergraduate study, you will also need to take courses in computer science, calculus, art history, and studio art</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chemistry</td>
    <td>It is a very good major to choose if you plan on getting into medical school </td>
    <td>You need to master difficult subject material such as biology, math, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and physical chemistry. Also almost two-thirds of chemistry majors go on to earn advanced degrees which is a necessity for most research positions </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mathematics</td>
    <td>It opens the doors up to actuarial science, data analysis, and finance, which can be extremely lucrative.</td>
    <td>As an undergrad, you’ll need to take courses in algebra, logic, geometry, and analysis. Also depending on your focus, you’ll also take advanced courses in applied or pure mathematics</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Physics</td>
    <td>Physics majors are well-prepared for further graduate study in physics or astronomy, or employment in a wide-range of sectors including Engineering and manufacturing, Computer programming/software design, Finance and management consulting, Defense and aerospace industry, High school science teaching, Journalism or science writing, Law and government, Medicine, Physics & Astronomy research</td>
    <td>Physics major have to take exeptionaly hard classes such as astrophysics, particle physics, and meteorology. Most also need to persue advanced degrees to get their choice of job.</td>
